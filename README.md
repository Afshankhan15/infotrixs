# Student Management System [MERN STACK]

 Users can access the dashboard to manage student records, including adding, viewing, editing, and deleting entries, encompassing name and email addresses. All data is securely stored in a MongoDB database. The project comprises two primary components: a React.js frontend and a Node.js backend.

## Key Features

🔵 **User Registration and Login:** Users register and log in using their Email and Password, ensuring a personalized and secure experience.

🟣 **User Authentication with JWT:** The application leverages JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for robust user authentication. Users must log in to access the dashboard features, guaranteeing data security.

🟡 **Record Management:** Upon logging in, users can perform the following actions within the dashboard for managing student records, including adding, viewing, editing, and deleting entries, encompassing name and email addresses. All data is securely stored in MongoDB.

🟢 **Logout:** Users can securely log out of the application at any time. This action removes the JWT token from local storage and safely redirects the user to the login page.

## Technologies Used:

🚀 **Frontend:** Developed using React.js, the frontend provides an intuitive and responsive user interface.

🔌 **Backend:** Powered by Node.js and Express.js, the backend handles API requests and ensures smooth communication between the frontend and the MongoDB database.

🗄️ **Database:** MongoDB is the database of choice for securely storing student records.
